___under development___

This project is a fork from [Studio-42/elFinder](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/commit/fca08559a3401614820de756971850e35bfa5c4b).

Differences:

- [ ] Node.js connector implement
- [ ] Will only keep the developed version from the forked commit. Probably will not merge the changes from that on
- [ ] Will replace the file hash with the readable path
- [ ] Will support multiple storage services:
    - [ ] LocalFileSystem
    - [ ] AWS
    - [ ] FTP
